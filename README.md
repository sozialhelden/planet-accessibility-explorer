# Planet Accessibility Explorer

**⚠️ This is experimental - Please don't expect anything from this app. It has accessibility issues, and probably still some bugs.**

Shows accessibility data found on OpenStreetMap.

Caveats:

- Not tested in production yet. Built for our own needs, might not fit your requirements
- Supports only a small subset of what's possible
- No replacement for 'real' accessibility apps like Wheelmap, accessmap.io, …

## Demo
